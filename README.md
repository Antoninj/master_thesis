# Low Cost Posturography

This repository hosts the source code written in the context of my master thesis work.
The goal is to investigate the potential of the Nintendo Wii Balance Board as an alternative device to force plates for postural steadiness measurements.

Previous studies focusing on time domain measures derived from the Center Of Pressure (COP) displacement have already been done in order to validate the reliability of the device.

My work is aiming at validating measures in the frequency domain. The repository can be seen as a posturography software toolbox which implements various algorithms related to the spectral analysis of the signal plus a validation study.
